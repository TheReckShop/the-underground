Building three levels of calendar with a potential eventual fourth.

  First level is embedded calendar in Google powder blue, with some effort at blending into the color palette of the site. The calendar is embedded. Need background image for the calendar page so that more blending can occur.

  Second level is calendar built with Javascript. This calendar will be static--events entered manually--but will fulfill the MVP for the project. This is part way done.

  Third level is styled embedded calendar. I had finished most of it before I found out that GitHub does not support the PHP it requires. I will finish it anyway.

  Fourth level is a someday goal. I want to use the Google calendar API to integrate the calendar entirely with the website. This is not possible at this time because the project forbids the use of JQuery.
