            <p class="dev-info">Hello my name is David Cole and I am from Seattle though I have lived all around the country. I have been working in the music industry for 15 years and if there is one thing that I have learned from my experiences is that there are no guaranties that you will have a job tomorrow. That is why I have chosen to become a web developer. The tech-industry is the fastest growing industry in America and web development is the new 'factory job' as in you can live comfortably off the wages and your career will not become obsolete any time soon. Being a web developer will change my life for the better and that's all I can ask.</p>

            <p class="dev-info">I initially wanted to be a developer as soon as I learned about computers, but was frightened away at the age of 17 when I walked in and saw my stepfather refactoring GW-BASIC code. Fortunately, I came to my senses and am now studying full stack web development at Code Fellows in Seattle.
            When I'm not trying to wrestle CSS into submission, I'm most likely to playing Destiny or a tabletop RPG.</p>
